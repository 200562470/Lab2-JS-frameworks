# Lab 2 - JavaScript Frameworks: Node.js & Modules

This project demonstrates the use of **Node.js** with custom modules. It includes the creation of two JavaScript files to work on the server-side and implement basic functions.

## Functions:

- **Function 1**: Accepts two parameters (like `firstName` and `lastName`) and prints a concatenated welcome message.
- **Function 2**: Converts measurement units (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit or minutes to hours).
- **Function 3**: Performs math operations like calculating the factorial of a number.
- **Function 4**: An advanced function of your choice (you can describe this here).

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in the terminal.
3. Run `node <entry-point-file>.js` to execute the project.
